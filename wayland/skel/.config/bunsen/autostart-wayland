## Bunsenlabs User config files
## All default BunsenLabs user config files are located in /usr/share/bunsen/skel.
## The script bl-user-setup copies them to the user $HOME directory on first login.
## See more info with command 'bl-user-setup --help'

## BunsenLabs autostart
## ====================
## When you login to your BunsenLabs session, this autostart script
## will be executed to launch any applications
## you want to run at startup.
##
## NB, like openbox's and labwc's autostart script, this uses the default shell,
## so "bashisms" are not supported.
##
## (Environment variables are set in ~/.config/bunsen/environment-wayland.)
##
## Note: some programs, such as 'nm-applet' are run via XDG autostart,
## from .desktop files in /etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart.
## To disable this, comment out the last line in this file:
## "bl-xdg-autostart"
##
## Run 'bl-xdg-autostart --list' to list any XDG autostarted programs.
##
## If you do something cool with your autostart script and you think others
## could benefit from your hack, please consider sharing it at:
## http://forums.bunsenlabs.org (registration required)
##

## NOTE: if you are using X you should not be running this file,
## so edit 'autostart' instead.

## WINDOW MANAGER / COMPOSITOR
## Do not edit the next line unless you have also installed any
## necessary other programs for the different window manager / compositor,
## and edited the window-manager-dependent section later in this file.
## Use the window manager's or compositor's actual command, not name.
## This should be the first uncommented line in this file:
window_manager=labwc

# test if chosen window manager is actually running (you should probably not edit this line)
pgrep -x -u "$USER" "$window_manager" || { echo "$0: Window manager $window_manager is not running." >&2 ; exit 1;}

### SETTINGS START

## Add keyboard mapping.
#xmodmap -e "keysym Insert = Multi_key"

### TOUCHPAD: comment out the next two entries if you don't have one

### TO DO - labwc has settings in ~/.config/labwc/rc.xml for touchpad
### other compositors have their own settings

### TOUCHPAD END
