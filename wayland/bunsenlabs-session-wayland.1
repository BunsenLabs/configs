.TH "BUNSENLABS-SESSION-WAYLAND" "1"
.SH "NAME"
bunsenlabs-session-wayland \(em Starts a BunsenLabs Wayland session.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-session-wayland\fR runs a BunsenLabs Wayland session,
calling a compositor and starting the necessary auxiliary applications.
There is no full session manager, so you will not be able
to save your state from one log in to the next.
Although labwc is the default BunsenLabs compositor or window manager,
users can select others while continuing to use the BunsenLabs
menu, keyboard shortcuts and autostarted applications (see below).
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-session-wayland\fR does not take any command line
arguments.
.PP
\fBbunsenlabs-session-wayland\fR is set as the Debian alternative
"wayland-session-manager" so it will be run by default in a Debian wayland
session, and a .desktop file is installed to /usr/share/wayland-sessions
so it can be started by a display manager like LightDM.
.PP
On log in, \fBbunsenlabs-session-wayland\fR will run the
~/.config/bunsen/autostart-wayland script if it exists, and will copy in the
default file from /usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart-wayland otherwise.
You may place anything you want to run automatically in this file, for example:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
conky -c $HOME/.config/conky/BL-Carbon-wayland-minimal-conky.conf &
wl-paste --watch cliphist store &
.fi
.RE
.PP
Make sure that each command that does not return quickly is followed by a "&" or else the script will
stop there and further commands will not be executed. You can use the
/usr/share/bunsen/skel/.config/bunsen/autostart-wayland file as an example for creating your
own.
.PP
.SS "Window Manager:"
Users can choose another compositor or window manager than the
default labwc by editing the line:

.PP
.RS
.PP
.nf
window_manager=labwc
.fi
.RE
.PP
near the top of ~/.config/bunsen/autostart-wayland. In such cases they will
probably want to adjust the autostarted applications, likely with a
new "case" clause for the new window manager. (See autostart-wayland for examples.)
